"""
The N queens puzzle is the challenge of placing N
non-attacking queens on an NÃ—N chessboard. Write a
program that solves the N queens problem.

sage: nqueens N
If the user called the program with the wrong number
of arguments, print Usage: nqueens N, followed by a new
line, and exit with the status 1
    where N must be an integer greater or equal to 4
    - If N is not an integer, print N must be a number, followed
    by a new line, and exit with the status 1

    - If N is smaller than 4, print N must be at least 4,
    followed by a new line, and exit with the status 1
